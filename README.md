##Popular Movies

This project is for an Android app called **PopularMovies** that returns a grid of the most popular OR top rated movies 
from themoviedb.org.
Clicking on any movie, loads some information about the movie (rating, synopsis, title, etc.) in a new screen.

## Before running: 
You will need to have your own API key from themoviedb.org. 
After generating one, edit the utilities/NetworkUtils.java class at the line:

`private final static String API_KEY = "[API-KEY-KEY-HERE]";`

so that API_KEY is set to your API key
